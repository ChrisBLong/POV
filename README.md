This is a simple Win32 project created to illustrate an interesting persistence of vision effect that I first came across when messing around with simple graphics on a BBC micro back in the 80s. Repeatedly drawing random white lines on a black background in XOR (exlcusive OR) mode results in new lines appearing on a random field of black and white pixels. Although this means that the lines don't show up as lines, your eyes and brain still detect the switching of a line of pixels from one state to the other as a line appearing, just for a fraction of a second.
I wanted to mimic the big, crisp pixels of an old 8-bit computer with a low-resolution display. I tried it in Javascript and then in a UWP Windows app, but it wasn't easy to get the effect I wanted (or perhaps I just didn't find the right technique).
In Win32, it's easy - I just create a low-resolution off-screen display context (DC) and then copy that to the main window of the app using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-stretchblt">StretchBlt</a> which does exactly what I wanted - a perfectly enlarged copy of the smaller bitmap with perfectly crisp edges to all the enlarged pixels.
When the app starts, nothing happens. Press L to draw a single random line or M to press multiple (10) lines. Press S to start the animation of the bouncing line and the cube. Press C to toggle the cube and N to toggle the line. Press E to toggle whether the background is erased on each new frame of the animation. Press R to reset everything (stop the animation and clear the screen).
